                Hello World!!!(Y'all must get tired of this cliche in portfolios by now) My name is Jared
                VanHook. I am a small-town kid from Indiana doing my best to find new ways to make my life
                easier
                and more exciting in this wild wild west of technology in the 21st century. I am happy to
                start this
                new decade learning valuable development and coding skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before getting into coding I went to
                school to be a Design Engineer. I achieved my Bachelor's of Science in Design Engineering
                Technologie s from Trine University in Angola, Indiana. Upon graduation I started work as a
                Distribution Design Engineer. Working with companys such as American Electric Power and
                Pacific Gas
                and Oil, I helped mantain and redesign many overhead and underground utility lines. During
                these
                projects I served as my own project coordinator and project manager assigning timelines and
                keeping
                project within scope and budget, while please the client in terms of quality and meeting
                their
                requests. These projects ranged from a length of several hundred feet and costs of
                $10,000/project
                to
                over 1 mile and $500,000.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moving forward I hope to use the skills I have learned from my time as an engineer in the
                utility
                field to further my development as a software engineer as well as use the skills I've
                learned from
                software development and use them in the utility industry
            </p>
