                <p id="me">
                    Hello World!!!(Y'all must get tired of this cliche in portfolios by now) My name is Jared
                    VanHook. I am a small-town kid from Indiana doing my best to find new ways to make my life easier
                    and more exciting in this wild wild west of technology in the 21st century. I am happy to start this
                    new decade learning valuable development and coding skills.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before getting into coding I went to
                    school to be a Design Engineer. I achieved my Bachelor's of Science in Design Engineering
                    Technologie s from Trine University in Angola, Indiana. Upon graduation I started work as a
                    Distribution Design Engineer. Working with companys such as American Electric Power and Pacific Gas
                    and Oil, I helped mantain and redesign many overhead and underground utility lines. During these
                    projects I served as my own project coordinator and project manager assigning timelines and keeping
                    project within scope and budget, while please the client in terms of quality and meeting their
                    requests. These projects ranged from a length of several hundred feet and costs of $10,000/project
                    to
                    over 1 mile and $500,000.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Moving forward I hope to use the skills I have learned from my time as an engineer in the utility
                    field to further my development as a software engineer as well as use the skills I've learned from
                    software development and use them in the utility industry
                </p>
